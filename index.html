Today, education remains a right for millions of children around the world. More than 72 million children of primary education age are not in school and 759 million adults are not really paying attention to it  and do not have the awareness to improve both their living conditions and those of their children. For many children who still do not have access to education, it is notable because of  inequality. Education is the most important thing for a child because if they did not have education growing up how will they learn how to count money for a job or tell time or really important things that a child needs to learn growing up. 
<p>
The biggest reason I believe that there is lack of education for some kids is because of the sex, and health, and culture. It could affect their social development. Many countries do not appropriate the  resources necessary to create schools, provide schooling materials, nor recruit and train teachers. I think that we are very lucky most people have the ability to have access to education and access to many things that other kids do not have the opportunity to do. Every place in the world I believe should have access to education and school and it should be mandatory like every school.
